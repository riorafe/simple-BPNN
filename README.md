# simple-BPNN
This was my 5th semester project when I was studying at Binus University.

The original code that being taught is Bpnn.py, then I improved it using Keras

### Preparation
Download the python code file including dataset and place them in the same folder, and now the code is ready to run.

I have explain the steps and any part of code function at the comment. Cheerio!
